next will ignore execution for current input if condition is true and jumps to the next input execution.
break will terminate the execution of most inner loop when the condition is true
    


3. Difference between redo and retry with examples.
     redo will only redo the execution of input where condition got true but retry will restarts executing loop all over again when condition is true.

eql? will return true when value and type of variable is same.
equal? Will return true if value,type and object_id of variables is same. 

5. List spread operators with examples.
 List spread operators will be ranges of inputs. If you use (..) two dots then it will include last input and in (…) three dots it will be excluded.
