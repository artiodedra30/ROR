(Note: 
  + Use Proc/Lambda in both programs.
  + I will change data while testing. these are just to illustrate definition.)

1. Create a text file called `array.txt` with content given below(NoCoding)
   [0, 1, 6, 3, 5, 8, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2, 7]

   Now, Create a program to read that array stored in the file.
   find out count of each unique element and 
   stored it in a hash if count is greater than 1 else append/stored in new file called output.txt

   Output should be:
   (on console):
   {0=>2, 1=>2, 6=>2, 5=>2, 8=>2, 2=>3}
   (in `output.txt`):
   {3=>1, 4=>1, 9=>1, 7=>1}

2. Create a text file called `phonebook.txt` with content given below(NoCoding)
   {'Ajay': '987643210', 'Shahrukh': '9876543211', 'Amitabh': '987654323'}

   Now, create a program to read the hash stored in the file.
   and give options to user
    to find out phone number with person's name.
    to save new number with name.
    to delete number by name or by number if present(give sub options for selecting by number or by name).
   Update file `phonebook.txt` with new hash details.
   (Put validations: Person name should be unique, Number should be unique)

3. Sort a hash by the values of another array. (Try to use logic instead of readymade methods)
   Input:
     elements = ['two', 'three', 'one']
     hash_to_be_sorted = {'three' => 3, 'two' => 2, 'one' => 1}
   Output:
     {'two'=>2, 'three'=>3, 'one'=>1}
